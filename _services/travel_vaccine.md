If you are planning foreign travel, you should book a consultation well in advance about necessary vaccines, malaria prescriptions and other medical advice regarding your destination. Requirements for any country can change according to various outbreaks.

You are advised to book at least 1 month in advance of your trip but if your journey is planned and will be a long stay in a remote part of the world, then 6 months in advance would be an advantage to get full immunity.

You can check which vaccines are required for your travel on the following website [http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk](www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk)

Killarney Medical Centre is a designated yellow fever centre, therefore we can provide this certification to persons who need this vaccine and receive it from our doctors. A certificate of yellow fever is obligatory if this disease is endemic in the country you are travelling to. However, there are also restrictions in adjacent countries, where you may have less risk of contracting the disease, but may be refused entry without a certificate of yellow fever vaccination.

You should bring a detailed itinerary for your travels when coming for travel health consultation.
