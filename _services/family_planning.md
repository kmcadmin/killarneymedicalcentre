###Contraceptive Advice

In-depth advice is available about the wide array of contraceptive options available to women and men. These include contraceptive pills, injections, barrier methods ( condoms - male and female, diaphragms ), intra-uterine devices ( Mirena, copper coils ), other longterm devices ( patch, vaginal ring ), permanent solutions ( Vasectomy, female sterilization )

The doctor will discuss these options in detail with you to help decide which is most suitable for you. Special procedures ( fitting of Implanon, Mirena or Copper coils ) must be discussed in advance at an earlier consultation with the doctor. We can also advise regarding crisis pregnancy options.

Choosing a method of contraceptive involves a balance between:

* How effective it is
* Possible risks and side effect
* Plans for future pregnancies
* If you have a medical condition that needs to be considered

###Combined Pills

Often just called ‘the pill’. It is more than 99% effective if used properly. Contains oestrogen and progestogen. Works by mainly by stopping ovulation. It is very popular. Different brands suit different people.

###Progestogen Only Pill ( POP )

Used to be called the ‘mini-pill’. Contains just a progestogen hormone. More than 99% effective if used properly. Is commonly taken if the combined pill is not suitable. For example: breast-feeding women, smokers over the age of 35, and some women with migraine. Works mainly by causing a plug of mucus in the cervix that blocks sperm, and thinning of the uterus. May also stop ovulation.

###Barrier methods

These include male condoms, female condom, diaphragms, and caps. Prevents sperm entering the uterus. Male condoms are about 98% effective if used properly.

###Contraceptive Injections ( Depo-Provera )

Contains a progestogen hormone which slowly releases into the body. More than 99% effective. Works by preventing ovulation and also has similar actions as the POP. An injection is needed every 8 - 12 weeks. Has the advantage of not having to remember to take pills.

###Contraceptive Implants ( Implanon )

An implant is a small device placed under the skin. It is inserted into the upper arm. Contains a progestogen hormone which slowly releases into the body. It is more than 99% effective. Works in a similar way to the contraceptive injection. Involves a small procedure under local anaesthetic. Each one lasts 3 years.

###Intrauterine Device ( Mirena )

Otherwise called the intrauterine ( IUS ). A plastic device that contains a progestogen hormone is put into the uterus. The progestogen is released at a slow but constant rate. More than 99% effective. Works in a similar way to the POP. It is also used to treat heavy period ( menorrhagia )

###Emergency Contraception

We offer advice regarding the need and options for emergency contraception. The postcoital pill, is commonly known as the ‘morning after pill’, can actually be taken up to 3 days after unprotected intercourse.

###Vasectomy

Our newest clinic [Vasectomy Kerry](http://www.vasectomykerry.ie) is the only provider of the No Scalpel technique in Kerry. This technique carries far less complications than traditional vasectomies and avoids the risk of general anaesthetic in hospital vasectomies. The procedure itself takes about 20 minutes to perform.

A [No-Scalpel Vasectomy](http://www.vasectomykerry.ie) is a safe and effective minor surgical procedure which can be easily performed under local anaesthetic. It is the most reliable method of long term contraception available. It can be provided in the convenience of the surgery and most men can return to normal activities within a few days. The benefit of No-Scalpel Vasectomy over conventional vasectomy is reduced discomfort, far less bruising and bleeding and a shorter recovery time after your vasectomy.

For more information please visit the [Vasectomy Kerry](http://www.vasectomykerry.ie) website.

###Female Sterilization

Please contact us to discuss this procedure and your referral options.

###Nuvaring

This is a small plastic ring which is inserted into the vagina and remains there for 3 weeks per month with a 1 week break after. A new ring is inserted every month. This is done by the woman herself.

###Evra Patch

This consists of 3 weekly patches per month with a 1 week break after. Many of these long term contraceptive options are particularly useful for women who are unsuited to the pill or forgetful about taking it.
