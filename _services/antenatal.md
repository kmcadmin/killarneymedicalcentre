Are you planning pregnancy? Did you know that all scheduled GP visits for antenatal care are provided free of charge via the HSE. This is to improve womens’ health in pregnancy and therefore improve the outcome for the baby.

Most pregnancies go well and without any major problems. But it is wise to reduce any risks as much as possible.

### Medical Conditions

Women with certain medical conditions may benefit from other advice becoming pregnant. See your doctor at Killarney Medical Centre if you have concerns about a medical condition which may affect pregnancy:

For some conditions, the medication or treatment may possibly affect the pregnancy or the unborn child. For example, epilepsy For some conditions, the condition itself may require special attention during the pregnancy. For example, diabetes If a hereditary condition runs in your family, you may benefit from genetic counseling

### Medication

The effects of some prescribed drugs have been well studied and it is known that certain drugs are safe in pregnancy. For example Paracetamol at normal doses is safe and useful for headaches, backaches and other aches and pains that may occur during pregnancy. However, some drugs are not safe, and may be harmful to a developing baby, particularly if you take them in the early weeks of pregnancy.

Therefore, always tell a doctor or dentist who prescribes you medication that you are pregnant, or intent to become pregnant. Also, don’t take drugs that you can buy ( including herbal remedies ) unless they are known to be safe in pregnancy. The pharmacist will advise.
