At Killarney Medical Centre we have a wide area of expertise in dermatology. Skin complaints are an extremely common consultation in general practice.

The more common skin conditions include:

* Acne
* Ezcema
* Psoriasis
* Rosacea
* Allergy
* Infections ( Bacterial, Fungal, Herpes virus )
* Hair loss
* Warts / verrucae
* Wounds
* Skin Cancer
* Sun damage

### Cryotherapy

This involves local application of liquid nitrogen to ‘freeze’ certain skin lesions. This causes the destruction of the lesion from deep under the skin and usually causes it to disappear.

Cryotherapy is suitable for treating simple warts, verrucae, skin tags, seborrhoeic keratosis and certain other conditions.

This is done by arrangement with the doctors in Killarney medical centre. In some cases, your health insurance ( VHI, Quinn, Vivas ) may cover the cost of such a procedure.

### Moles

Are you concerned about suspicious-looking moles, or freckles which have changed in appearance? You should make an appointment with the doctor if you have concerns as you may need further referrals.
